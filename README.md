# Eastern Scheduler - a Chrome browser extension for selecting schedules at Eastern #

## Installation ##
1. A development version of Eastern Scheduler is currently available. Download the zip file from the following link: 
[https://github.com/gdancik/EasternScheduler/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/gdancik/EasternScheduler/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the file. This will create an EasternScheduler-master folder.
3. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

## Using the Scheduler ##
1. Open Eastern's class schedule page. Do not try to search for any specific classes. Instead get a list of all available classes by clicking on the Class Search button.
2. Open the Scheduler by clicking on the 'E' icon. Enter the courses you wish to take, and click the Find classes button. A new page will open with available schedule.

Note that the extension currently assumes that all courses are semester long courses.
